# Live-Mask-Detection
In this covid pandemic mask is not a choice but need. Here is this project i have trained a model which predicts whether a person is wearing a mask or not and aslo simultaneously detects it in live stream.

Two models are trained first is a simple CNN model and second is transfer learning model using inception_v3.
live prediction is done using openCV.
